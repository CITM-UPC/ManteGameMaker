  Telemetry
  ---------
  vcpkg collects usage data in order to help us improve your experience.
  The data collected by Microsoft is anonymous.
  You can opt-out of telemetry by re-running the bootstrap-vcpkg script with -disableMetrics,
  passing --disable-metrics to vcpkg on the command line,
  or by setting the VCPKG_DISABLE_METRICS environment variable.

  The package glew is compatible with built-in CMake targets:
  
      find_package(GLEW REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE GLEW::GLEW)
  
  The package opengl is compatible with built-in CMake targets via CMake v3.7 and prior syntax
  
      find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES})
      target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR})
  
  and the CMake v3.8 and beyond imported target syntax
  
      find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE OpenGL::GL)

  The OpenGL SDK is highly platform dependent and is usually an OS component. It's not realistic to build from source for every platform.
  
      WINDOWS: is part of the Windows SDK which this package installs.
      LINUX: the SDK may be installed from your distro's repo or from 3rd parties manually. There are too many to count.
