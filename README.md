This is a 3d Game Engine called Mantel Game Engine created by Mantel, here you can see our project:

Our organization is called Mantel and it's formed by 2 students of UPC in Barcelona:
- Luis González Ramírez ~ https://github.com/punto16

To use the engine you can use the same camera control system as Unity program. To create some meshes you can acces the top bar to create them. As you are now in the top bar you can see a plenty of actions, close the engine, see engine details, our organization details, create meshes, options, etc.

- Drag and Drop .fbx files to load them.
- Drag and Drop texture files to the fbx already loaded in the fbx files to add the texture.
